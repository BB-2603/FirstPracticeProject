This project is basically a simple page consisting of three components namely: Calculator, ToDo List and API.

Calculator: It is a simple calculator which can be used to perform simple calculations.

To Do List: It is a page where you can add the tasks you want to do. You can either delete the saved task or you can use the checkbox to mark if it's done.

API: It is somewhat like Postman API where you can send GET or POST requests and see the outputs.

PS: I have not paid much attention to the css part so it may look somewhat unattractive.
